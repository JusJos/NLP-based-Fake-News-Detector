A Fake News Detecting ML Model using NLP!

Successfully created a Fake News Detecting Model using NLP! 🎉

🔖 Throughout the process was able to perform various tasks :

🏷 Import libraries and datasets
🏷 Preliminary data processing
🏷 Perform Exploratory data analysis
🏷 Perform data cleaning
🏷 Visualize datasets
🏷 Tokenization and padding
🏷 Understand the intuition behind RNN and LSTMs
🏷 Train an LSTM Model
🏷 Assess trained model performance

I had a wonderful learning opportunity where I worked with libraries like TensorFlow, plotly, spacy, WordCloud, gensim, pandas, Keras, NumPy, seaborn and many more.
